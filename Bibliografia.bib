	abstract = {Context:
	Applying Microservices Architecture (MSA) in DevOps has received significant attention in recent years. However, there exists no comprehensive review of the state of research on this topic.
	Objective:
	This work aims to systematically identify, analyze, and classify the literature on MSA in DevOps.
	Methods:
	A Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) has been conducted on the literature published between January 2009 and July 2018.
	Results:
	Forty-seven studies were finally selected and the key results are: (1) Three themes on the research on MSA in DevOps are “microservices development and operations in DevOps”, “approaches and tool support for MSA based systems in DevOps”, and “MSA migration experiences in DevOps”. (2) 24 problems with their solutions regarding implementing MSA in DevOps are identified. (3) MSA is mainly described by using boxes and lines. (4) Most of the quality attributes are positively affected when employing MSA in DevOps. (5) 50 tools that support building MSA based systems in DevOps are collected. (6) The combination of MSA and DevOps has been applied in a wide range of application domains.
	Conclusion:
	The results and findings will benefit researchers and practitioners to conduct further research and bring more dedicated solutions for the issues of MSA in DevOps.}

You learned in the last chapter that Agile and Scrum, Lean Engineering, and DevOps provide a methodology and process framework for high-velocity product development. You learned that cloud platforms provide an excellent foundation for SaaS solutions with their on-demand infrastructure and application services. Finally, you identified microservice architecture as the optimal architecture for cloud-hosted solutions. In this chapter, we will define microservices and discuss both the benefits and the challenges of this new approach.",

	abstract = {The microservices architecture is widely regarded as a promising approach to service-oriented systems. However, developing applications in the microservices architecture presents three main challenges: (a) how to program systems that consists of a large number of services running in parallel and distributed over a cluster of computers, (b) how to reduce the communication overhead caused by executing a large number of small services, (c) how to support the flexible deployment of services to a network to achieve system load balance. This paper presents a programming language called CAOPLE and reports the implementation of the language on a virtual machine called CAVM-2. The paper demonstrates how this approach meets these challenges.},

	abstract = {Microservices is an architectural style increasing in popularity. However, there is still a lack of understanding how to adopt a microservice-based architectural style.
	We aim at characterizing different microservice architectural style patterns and the principles that guide their definition.
	We conducted a systematic mapping study in order to identify reported usage of microservices and based on these use cases extract common patterns and principles.
	We present two key contributions.
	Firstly, we identified several agreed microservice architecture patterns that seem widely adopted and reported in the case studies identified.
	Secondly, we presented these as a catalogue in a common template format including a summary of the advantages, disadvantages, and lessons learned for each pattern from the case studies.
	We can conclude that different architecture patterns emerge for different migration, orchestration, storage and deployment settings for a set of agreed principles.},
