	abstract = {Context:
	Applying Microservices Architecture (MSA) in DevOps has received significant attention in recent years. However, there exists no comprehensive review of the state of research on this topic.
	Objective:
	This work aims to systematically identify, analyze, and classify the literature on MSA in DevOps.
	Methods:
	A Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) has been conducted on the literature published between January 2009 and July 2018.
	Results:
	Forty-seven studies were finally selected and the key results are: (1) Three themes on the research on MSA in DevOps are “microservices development and operations in DevOps”, “approaches and tool support for MSA based systems in DevOps”, and “MSA migration experiences in DevOps”. (2) 24 problems with their solutions regarding implementing MSA in DevOps are identified. (3) MSA is mainly described by using boxes and lines. (4) Most of the quality attributes are positively affected when employing MSA in DevOps. (5) 50 tools that support building MSA based systems in DevOps are collected. (6) The combination of MSA and DevOps has been applied in a wide range of application domains.
	Conclusion:
	The results and findings will benefit researchers and practitioners to conduct further research and bring more dedicated solutions for the issues of MSA in DevOps.}

You learned that cloud platforms provide an excellent foundation for SaaS solutions with their on-demand infrastructure and application services.

In this chapter, we will define microservices and discuss both the benefits and the challenges of this new approach.",

However, developing applications in the microservices architecture presents three main challenges: (a) how to program systems that consists of a large number of services running in parallel and distributed over a cluster of computers, (b) how to reduce the communication overhead caused by executing a large number of small services, (c) how to support the flexible deployment of services to a network to achieve system load balance. This paper presents a programming language called CAOPLE and reports the implementation of the language on a virtual machine called CAVM-2. The paper demonstrates how this approach meets these challenges.},

	abstract = {Microservices is an architectural style increasing in popularity. However, there is still a lack of understanding how to adopt a microservice-based architectural style.
	We aim at characterizing different microservice architectural style patterns and the principles that guide their definition.
	We conducted a systematic mapping study in order to identify reported usage of microservices and based on these use cases extract common patterns and principles.
	We present two key contributions.
	Firstly, we identified several agreed microservice architecture patterns that seem widely adopted and reported in the case studies identified.
	Secondly, we presented these as a catalogue in a common template format including a summary of the advantages, disadvantages, and lessons learned for each pattern from the case studies.
	We can conclude that different architecture patterns emerge for different migration, orchestration, storage and deployment settings for a set of agreed principles.},

	abstract = {Microservices play a more and more important role in software development nowadays. Almost every programming language has its own microservices development framework. The characteristics of microservices make microservices have cross-platform compatibility issues and inconsistent call standards issues in the process of development and call microservices. The birth of API Gateway alleviates these problems to some extent. For small and medium-sized enterprises using today's popular API Gateways, it is difficult for them to get a balance between cost, performance and maintainability. This paper proposes a scheme to optimize the API Gateway. Firstly, the framework of API Gateway is optimized. Next, the coupling degree of API Gateway is optimized by reducing the coupling degree of core services and extended functions. In this way, the optimized Gateway can adapt to the plug-in mode, improve the user experience and reduce development costs. Then, the persistent design of the configuration information of the API Gateway is carried out, and the read-write optimization is carried out so that the optimized API Gateway not only has advantages in the configuration persistence, but also has further improved the I/O performance. Based on the optimized design, this paper implements a cross platform compatible API Gateway. Then it compares the performance of two popular API Gateway schemes through performance testing. The test results show that the optimized design of API Gateway achieves a new balance among cost, performance and maintainability. At the end of this paper, the work of this paper is summarized, and the next work is projected.}
