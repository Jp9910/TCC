    - Micro
        Micro is a microservices **toolkit**. It was built to be opinionated in itâ€™s features and interfaces while 
        providing a powerful pluggable architecture allowing the underlying dependencies to be swapped out.

        - Features

            - Server

                Micro is built as a microservices architecture and abstracts away the complexity of the underlying infrastructure. We compose this as a single logical server to the user but decompose that into the various building block primitives that can be plugged into any underlying system.

                The server is composed of the following services.

                    API - HTTP Gateway which dynamically maps http/json requests to RPC using path based resolution
                    Auth - Authentication and authorization out of the box using jwt tokens and rule based access control.
                    Broker - Ephemeral pubsub messaging for asynchronous communication and distributing notifications
                    Config - Dynamic configuration and secrets management for service level config without the need to restart
                    Events - Event streaming with ordered messaging, replay from offsets and persistent storage
                    Network - Inter-service networking, isolation and routing plane for all internal request traffic
                    Proxy - An identity aware proxy used for remote access and any external grpc request traffic
                    Runtime - Service lifecycle and process management with support for source to running auto build
                    Registry - Centralised service discovery and API endpoint explorer with feature rich metadata
                    Store - Key-Value storage with TTL expiry and persistent crud to keep microservices stateless
                    Web - Simple web dashboard with dynamic forms to describe and query services in the browser

            - Framework

                Micro additionally contains a built in Go framework for service development. The Go framework makes it drop dead simple to write your services without having to piece together lines and lines of boilerplate. Auto configured and initialised by default, just import and get started quickly.

            - Command Line

                Micro brings not only a rich architectural model but a command line experience tailored for that need. The command line interface includes dynamic command mapping for all services running on the platform. Turns any service instantly into a CLI command along with flag parsing for inputs. Includes support for multiple environments and namespaces, automatic refreshing of auth credentials, creating and running services, status info and log streaming, plus much, much more.

            - Environments

                Finally Micro bakes in the concept of Environments and multi-tenancy through Namespaces. Run your server locally for development and in the cloud for staging and production, seamlessly switch between them using the CLI commands micro env set [environment] and micro user set [namespace].
