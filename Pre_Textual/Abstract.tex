 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
   This paper analyzes the development of applications with microservice architecture, exposing the characteristics of this architectural approach and gathering and discussing good practices used in its development, through literature research and review. The result is a set of common characteristics and good practices well established in the development of such applications. Furthermore, it has been identified a certain level of disagreement between respected authors in this area about the practice of starting with a simpler architectural approach, such as the monolithic one, before utilizing microservices, issue in which there is more space for discussions and case studies.
