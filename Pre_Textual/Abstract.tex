 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
   This paper examines the development of applications with a microservice architecture, discussing the common characteristics of this architectural approach and gathering good practices and tools used in its development, through literature research and review. The result is a set of good practices and tools well established in the development of such applications. It has also been identified a certain level of disagreement about the practice of starting with a simpler architectural approach such as the monolithic one before utilizing microservices, idea in which there is more space for discussions and case studies.
